Every teenager in this world is in search of the magic feeling; that strong emotion that binds the entire universe together;that brings together people and makes life possible. The strong enticing enigma called true love.
There are so many articles and ideas on this that it is very difficult to relate to all of them.

>True Love is a conspiracy. A fail safe mechanism designed by nature to bring different people together in order to maintain the variabality and diversity within a species. 

Flabbergasted! Are you.
Lets see why I said so.

There is no doubt of the fact that love deals with people and brings people closer to each other. To understand love, we need to first understand people and how our emotions react to different situations.

#The Romantic Type

Every person is exposed to a variety of environments during the course of his life. All these environments provide some amount of emotional response within the person. These emotional responses account for all the good and bad experiences he has had in different environments. With each experience, our human mind tries to learn something so that the mind can better deal with the experience in future. The more experiences you have, the more you will learn. Just like the saying: *Wisdom comes with experience*

Lets try to understand this with an example:

There are two young boys and both of them are given two tasks. The first task is to steal from a 

#The Compromising Type

We have already established that your love for someone is a very personal choice which depends on your past experiences. If someone's character traits make up the majority of traits in your good books, you immediately start liking the other person. So, love is not an instant thing but it is planned by your subconcious way before you actually meet your love. 

Now, the problem is what if you do not fall in the good books of your love or you are not the type your partner desires. This is seldom the case because meeting your romantic type and having all the qualities of your partner's romantic type is highly improbable as each person's romantic type is very unique.

The solution is that the person who does not get his/her romantic type will compromise. She will love the fact that you love her but she will never be actually in love with you in the same way you are in love with her. The reason for this compromise lies in the fact that every person feels the need to be loved by someone, to be cared by someone, to rely on someone and to know that someone will be there for her when she is down. This need to be loved overshadows the desire to love someone and the person makes a compromise for the greater good.

> But the truth is that being loved by someone and loving someone irrevocably are not the same. You feel nice that someone cares for you but you are missing the spark of emotions- the feeling of love. Thus, the person who makes this compromise will always be more rational in the relationship and will be a controlling and dominating factor in the relationship. This person is the compromising type.

##The Grand Conspiracy

In the end, you and your partner will never love each other in the same way. One person will always be dominating and the other person will always be subdued but the levels of this domination and submission will always vary.

Supposing, you are in love with someone and you are in a healthy relationship with him/her. It has been only possible because your partner gave up searching for his/her love and accepted you by making the compromise. 

Let's take an ideal world where every peron's romantic type is unqiue and everyone has found the people they love. There are 3 couples existing in this world named as Couple1,Couple2,Couple3 as given in the diagram. The arrow shows which person loves whom.

Thus, if there are 6 billion people in the world and assuming every person has one unique romantic type in some part of the world. Then, only half the people of the world will ever find their true love in an ideal world.
In reality, there may be
