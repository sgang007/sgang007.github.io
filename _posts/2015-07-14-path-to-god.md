title: "Moksha: Search for God"
published: true

For centuries, we have always wondered and be amazed by the concept of an omnipresent, omniscient and omnipotent God whose power is responsible for the existence of our universe. And people who are amazed by this concept keep pursuing this for decades until they fade into oblivion. But no one till date has been able to prove the existence of such a power and we have always been known to be the masters of our own fate. This is has been the longest and most endearing research project of mankind and it has no concludable answers till date.

The simple reason for this is because we have been looking in the wrong place. While we have been looking for an all powerful source of creation in the microscopic universe to the distant galaxies, the real God power resides within us and each living being on this planet holds a potential to become this omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient source. The only way we are going to become this person is through the journey or the path to God. It is this lifelong search for God through which we truly become a source of knowledge, wisdom and power. 

Whatever I said till now was just mere philosophy which might appeal some people, most people will definitely not concur with it until a logical and sound argument is provided of whatever philosophy I just said. Now, I will try to tell my views and experiences in my search for God.

In our search for God, each day our brain learns and develops some new things until we reach the truth. With each new development, our understanding of the world changes and we each day face more questions than we have solved. And through this quest, we pass through different phases in our personality until we meet our destiny.

- **The Logical Mind - phase of questioning**

Our most primitive mindset and our basic intelligence is governed by our survival instinct. To stay alive, we need to eat and fulfil our basic amenities. So, when we are hungry, we look for food; when we need food, we look for money; when we need money, we look for a job; when we need a job, we look for the education required to get the job; when we need the education, we look for colleges who can give that education; when we need the help of colleges, we look for tutors who can help us get to this college - and the list goes on endlessly. In this competitive and overpopulated world, at a certain point of time we realize that just doing what we need to do might not get us what we want. So, we would need to prevent others from getting what they want so that we might get what we want. And this results to cut-throat competition, selfish behaviour and a lot of other evils which is just the correct attitude one needs to have if he has to survive. And finally everything we fight for and all evils in this world just boils down to one simple truth: Survival of the fittest. In due course, our world has become capable of containing everyone and even when we have all the resources for survival of everyone, we still keep fighting because the nature of a fight is that it never ends.

>As a result of this fight for survival, we develop a keen sense of our logical mind. We start thinking in terms of black and white - we divide the entire world into things that are right and should be done and things that are wrong that shouldn't be done. 

We categorize things based on the logic whether something will help us in our survival or not. Things that will help us are the right things and things that will not help us are wrong. For example, studying for your exams, getting a good marks, doing a good job, living a stable life and caring for your family are all the correct things and the opposite of all these are the bad things that shouldn't be done. *Making the correct choices and how fit you are for survival shows how intelligent you are. This is a person's logical mind, which is measured by the Intelligent Quotient (IQ).* Having a good IQ helps us to make rational decisions and logical choices so that we can have the maximum gain in this fight for survival.

- **The Emotional Mind - phase of understanding**

After a long fight, we soon realize the world does not exist in right and wrong. There is no truth and there is no lie. The entire world lies in  gray and everything is just perception and a version of the truth. While to someone, getting good marks is logical but to others studying in teenage years when it is time for fun is equally illogical. The unifying cause for this difference is perception of different people toward different things. The moment we renounce the fight for survival, we begin to understand the perception of different people and then we interact with other people based on perception. As we understand the perspectives of different people, we begin to develop emotions for them. When we interact with someone with a similar perception as ours, we end of loving them and with someone with a different perception as ours, we might end up hating them.

But the thing about emotions is that the reverse can also be true and there is no universal right or wrong when it comes to emotions. To an emotional mind, right and wrong is based on individual perception and what maybe right to someone will be wrong to someone. So, in the end, emotions is all about how you develop your perception and how you understand perceptions of others. Since perceptions are subjective to people, emotions are all about people and how you realte to people; it is the ability of a person to handle different emotions of different people to interact with them in a way that is conducive to everyone. This is called emotional intelligence.

>So, while with the logical mind, we can understand the most innate characteristics and basic urges of the world; with the emotional mind, we can understand our true nature and personality as a whole. We can now understand why we think the way we do. Now, the next question is why do we have such emotions and why are emotions different to different people. Does this mean that with each unique set of emotions, each person has a unique purpose in life?

- **The Spiritual Mind- phase of knowledge**
After we have the ability to undestand ourselves and others, we will realize that everything that we do and everyone that we interact with is in some way changing the future dynamically. All our actions is in some way affecting us and everyone we know. I don't have a profound logical explaination for this but if you look for it, you will observe it too. 

One way to observe this link and universal nature of the world is with a simple experiment that you can do. On a particular day, you suddenly do something that you did not intend to or which is way out of your ordinary routine and you observe how the events of the day are panning out because of your choice. You will notice that a vast number of odd things have happened that day and if you carefully try to fit all of them together- you will realize it all resulted because of the choice you made. For example, one day purposely and suddenly do not to go to college and then observe the events going on that day. Suppose, hypothetically, when you did not go to class, seeing you and getting inspired from you - some of your friends also stayed back and when the teacher came saw the low attendance and decided to take a test to teach everyone a lesson. The duration for the test got prolonged more than usual and the teacher was late to catch the last bus to his home. Since the teacher reached home late, some more things happened and the entire course of events for that day for everyone changed suddenly. Supposing you had decided to go to class, your friends would have followed, the teacher would not have taken the test and he would have left early and caught the last bus and reached home in time. 

>So, for every decision that you are taking you are not only affecting yourself but the entire world as a whole. You are continuously changing the future without your knowledge and you can never avoid it. And so you realize that the entire universe though divided among different categories, it is actually one big interlinked entity that is pulsating continuously and for each small change each living thing is making which is changing the course of the entire universe and this single entity as a whole. And in the words of a mechanical engineer, the entropy of the universe is continuously increasing and with each step you take, it is becoming more randon than before.

So, if you want something desperately in life and you make the right choices in life, your choices will somehow contribute in such a way that the future gravitates towards you attaining what you want. The universe is continuously changing to give everybody what they want.

- **The Divine Mind - phase of reconcilation**

After you can see the entire world and all its good and evil as a part of one big entity, you can no longer be afraid of anything because you will realize good and evil are part of the same manifestation and they are all same. It is just people who have classified certain things as good and other things as evil. There is no good and there is no evil because they are all parts of the same entity.

So, now the final question is what is this universal truth?

When you can see the entire world as one single universal entity, you can observe the world like you observe the motion of a simple bouncing ball. Like a ball moves downward hits the ground and bounces back and then returns and slowly goes to rest. Once you have this vision, you can also observe the entire world in a similar way and how the entire world is changing by each action that you are taking and then you will realize which action is best for you and what should you do to get what you want.

> In this divine mind, you can close your eyes and see more than you can with your eyes open. You can see how the 9/11 attacks changed the course of history and how ultimately it has been beneficial for the development of India. You can see how the greatest discoveries of the world are simple falasies which went on to deteriorationg the world and you can understand the raw- bitter truth about everything you like to see. It is at this point, when the past - present and future are like one single channel flow of time across ages and each step is a prelude to the next. And how everything is destined because of the unique set of desires every person in this world has at every moment of time.

This is an amazing sight. Finally, you realize you are capable of anything and everything you can dream of. You can watch any thing you want to see and you know how the future is progessing and you know how your actions are effecting the future. So, by choosing your actions wisely- you can control the future of the entire universe. Thus by definition, you are God. Though, I frankly believe, it is an overhyped word.

- **Moksha - the final reunion**

Once you have these amazing newfound powers you will have achieved everything you ever wanted and have seen all that you needed to see- your cup of desire is now full. Your heart will be satisfied and you require nothing except peace.
The only motivation in your life now is for the betterment of humankind. You will want to spread this knowledge and reveal this truth to everyone but you can't. 

You cannot reveal the truth because the truth is so convoluted that only people who have traversed this path will truly understand. There will be some people who will ignore you blatantly and some others who will follow you blindly. But neither of them will have either the patience or the strength to follow this path that you have followed. And the few people who has the strength to discover it will ultimately discover it with or without your help.

>It is then you will realize the pointlessness of your existence. Your existence merely served the purpose of preventing the universe from going to a stagnant mode. You only helped the future to change but you cannot control the future you want because there are somethings about the future that cannot be changed. Finally, you will sit down and reflect on all your actions and decisions that you have made and the causes for your actions and the future that resulted from your decision. You can now see your entire life in front of you - the past, present and future. With this thought and visions in mind, you will lose interest in everything and slowly get lost into oblivion. You will create an imaginary world of perfection within your mind and live in it while losing all touch with the physical plane. 

But that is a long way home. 

For now, contemplate by trying to understanding yourself and then try understanding all those around you. By understand, I don't mean to be compassionate but be understanding while trying to look from their different perspective. All these different perspectives will assimilate in your mind to give you an idea of the world. In no time, you will be on correct path.

This ends my long and complicated post.
Close your eyes and arrange all the things I said one after the other until you form an entire idea of what I mean by the words I wrote. And when you get a good idea of my thoughts, place yourself and design a path for yourself to get what you want. See where you are in this path. Choose the next step wisely and keep following this path you set for yourself.

*Please note, all the terms used in this post like divine mind, spiritual mind, moksha and other terms have no relevant meaning in my personal opinion. I used this terms specifially so that my readers can realate to what I am saying. But please don't be dissuaded by a pre-built opinion or prejudice on this concepts or words. They are just words and hold meaning only when you attach meaning to them.*
