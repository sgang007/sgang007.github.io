Wow! I am writing my first post using github and jekyll. This is much easier than google app engine. 
Well, this is going to be my main site and I am going to post about the projects that I am doing here.
In my previous blog, the first post was all about my egocentric self rambling about the deeds of myself and others.
So this time, its going to be about my work and interests.
Currently, I am working on a blind robot capable of localization and navigation using only sonars. I am using ROS as my main software architecture and the Raspberry Pi as the core hardware architechture. Though, I strongly believe that the Pi won't be able to run all our algorithms properly. We might then have to shift to a Beagle Bone Black or any other good development platform then.

I got back my team, funds are not much of a problem anymore, Sandipan Sir is helping me a lot understand the twists and turns of probabilistic analysis. Hopefully, if all goes well, my project will be completed by May, 2015. And I will have a paper to showcase myself to the ivy league colleges.
