title: "Moksha: Search for God"
published: true

For centuries, we have always wondered and be amazed by the concept of an omnipresent, omniscient and omnipotent God whose power is responsible for the existence of our universe. And people who are amazed by this concept keep pursuing this for decades until they fade into oblivion. But no one till date has been able to prove the existence of such a power and we have always been known to be the masters of our own fate. This is has been the longest and most endearing research project of mankind and it has no concludable answers till date.

The simple reason for this is because we have been looking in the wrong place. While we have been looking for an all powerful source of creation in the microscopic universe to the distant galaxies, the real God power resides within us and each living being on this planet holds a potential to become this omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient source. The only way we are going to become this person is through the journey or the path to God. It is this lifelong search for God through which we truly become a source of knowledge, wisdom and power. 

Whatever I said till now was just mere philosophy which might appeal some people, most people will definitely not concur with it until a logical and sound argument is provided of whatever philosophy I just said. Now, I will try to tell my views and experiences in my search for God.

In our search for God, each day our brain learns and develops some new things until we reach the truth. With each new development, our understanding of the world changes and we each day we face more question than we solved. And through this quest, we pass through different phases in our personality until we meet our destiny.

- #The Logical Mind - phase of questioning
Our most primitive mindset and our basic intelligence is governed by our survival instinct. To stay alive, we need to eat and fulfil our basic amenities. So, when we are hungry, we look for food; when we need food, we look for money; when we need money, we look for a job; when we need a job, we look for the education required to get the job; when we need the education, we look for colleges who can give that education; when we need the help of colleges, we look for tutors who can help us get to this college - and the list goes on endlessly. In this competitive and overpopulated world, at a certain point of time we realize that just doing what we need to do might not get us what we want. So, we would need to prevent others from getting what they want so that we might get what we want. And this results to cut-throat competition, selfish behaviour and a lot of other evils which is just the correct attitude one needs to have if he has to survive. And finally everything we fight for and all evils in this world just boils down to one simple truth: Survival of the fittest. In due course, our world has become capable of containing everyone and we have all the resources for survival of everyone but the nature of a fight is that it never ends.

>As a result of this fight for survival, we develop a keen sense of our logical mind. We start thinking in terms of black and white - we divide the entire world into things that are right and should be done and things that are wrong that shouldn't be done. 

We categorize things based on the logic whether something will help us in our survival or not.  For example, studying for your exams, getting a good marks, doing a good job, living an honest life and caring for your family are all the correct things and the opposite of all these are the bad things that shouldn't be done. *Making the correct choices and how fit you are survival shows how intelligent you are and this is the logical mind, which is measured by someone's IQ.*

- #The Emotional Mind - phase of understanding
After a long fight, we soon realize the world does not exist in right and wrong. There is no truth and there is no lie. The entire world lies in  gray and everything is just perception and a version of the truth. While to someone, getting good marks is logical and to others studying in teenage years when it is time for fun is equally illogical. The unifying cause for this difference is perception of different people toward different things. The moment we renounce the fight for survival, we begin to understand the perception of different people and then we interact with other people based on perception. As we understand the perspectives of different people, we begin to develop emotions for them. When we interact with someone with a similar perception as ours, we end of loving them and with someone with a different perception as ours, we might end up hating them.

But the thing about emotions is that the reverse can also be true and there is no universal right or wrong when it comes to emotions. To an emotional mind, right and wrong is based on individual perception and what maybe right to someone will be wrong to someone. So, in the end, emotions is all about how you develop your perception and how you understand perceptions of others. Since perceptions are subjective to people, emotions are all about people and how you interact with people and the ability of a person to handle different emotions of different people to interact with them in a way that is conducive to everyone is called emotional intelligence.

>In due course, we realize God is something universal and neither logic nor emotions can explain God. While with the logical mind, we can understand our most innate characteristics and basic urges, with the emotional mind, we can understand our true nature and personality as a whole. We can now understand why we think the way we do. Now, the next question is why do we have such emotions and why are emotions different to different people. Does this mean that with each unique set of emotions, each person has a unique purpose in life?
