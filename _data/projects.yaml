  content: This project contains a framework for submitting the standard coursera assignments for the Machine Learning Course in Python. This allows learners to explore scipy, panda and other powerful python libraries while submitting the assignments. A cross platform GUI is built using Kivy on top of this base interface which makes assignment submission and completion mobile friendly.
