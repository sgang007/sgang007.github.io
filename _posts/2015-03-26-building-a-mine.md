In this fast paced world, we are continuously making targets and planning to achieve them. We are always running to achieve something or the other. In our pursuit, we have forgotten to live life like it is and are existing under an illision that is far from reality.

To make things worse, we have very few people around us who can guide us to the correct path and help us differentiate the fact from the faction.

#Winning Personality
We are talking about winning but we never mentioned what is it that you are trying to win. Well, we can say winning is if you have been successful in achieving the things we set out for. Now, the question rises what is it that we have actually set out for. Is it at all feasible? Can we ever be successful? What if our fortune does not favour us? What is the universe pulls us down?

With all these questions in mind, we strive forward to make the correct decisions in what is that we are trying yo achieve. In the next few lines, I would guide you how to make the correct decision in what you are trying to achieve in life.

Close your eyes and imagine yourself lying in your death bed in an hospital fighting cancer and you know that you will be dead within the week. Do you have any regrets? What are the things that you regret not having done in your life?

Have you not spend enough time with your family?
Have you not secured the future of your family and not fulfilled your responsibilities?
Have you not made use of your life in any way?
Have you not contributed to the benefit of mankind?

Which is the regret that haunts you the most?

Based on your choice, now think what could you have done so that you will not have that regeret. This is your action that you should do now.

Now, based on the action are you striving to your goal and have you won? If not, you are not a winning personality.

#Winning the correct way

Winning is very important. It gives people confidence to do things that he might have not known was possible for him. It raises his own self image and makes him more confident which helps him to win more. 

But what is more important is winning and helping others to win as well. This is the notion of winning the correct way. Unless you win the correct way, all your spoils of the game are pointless.

Elements of winning the correct way:
-------------------------------------
- First step, is perseverence. Hard work is the only way to win. Unless you work hard, all your dreams are pointless.
- Secondly, you need to have talent in what you are trying to achieve. It is pointless if you are trying to play cricket but you walk with a limp. I am not saying that it is impossible to achieve without talent but it is very difficult and improbable. Why do it the hard way if there is an easier way available.
- Thirdly, proper guidance and distraction free focus until you reach your goal is very important. To inculcate this, you have to give away your pride and all notion of self confidence that you have. You need to be humble and accepting.
