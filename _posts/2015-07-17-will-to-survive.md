title: The Will to Survive

I wrote this poem a long time back during my first semester in college in a state of mind when I was lonely, depressed and frustrated with everything in life. I showed this poem to several people at that time and everyone liked it mostly because of its poetic appeal. But yesterday after writing my post on 'Moksha', I remembered this poem I had once written and now looked at it from a whole new different angle. I had these concepts of life in my subconscious mind long back but yesterday, I could construct it and represent them in a way by which most people could understand. 
So, to complete my idea of Life and bring forth an element of elegance, I am putting up this lost poem in my blog today.

*Please read my previous post on Moksha before reading this poem to understand the real meaning of the words I had said.*


>If life was like a viking ship and the universe the sea,

>And I could sail away the horizon until I reach the sands of time;

>I would then be dreaming away to loiter in a limitless paradise,

>And lose myself in an unconscious world

>Without any knowledge of life and death.

>But if the world with all its bitter berries and better butters,

>Suddenly stares at me in my weakest moment..

>When I am treading under the wings of my utopia,

>When I am alone and pondering in my mind 

>Of rash impudency and childish callowness;

>My dandy looks are immature then, to my bevelled thoughts.

>Suddenly, something strikes me like thunder from the sky

>And I look up to the heavens for guidance.

>As the bile fills my stomach and I,

>in fear of the unknown, only pray that I may evade the storm.

>But the pungent truth bitters my rosy tongue

>As the universe tears apart my chastity;

>And I am left in solitude with the blank ceiling mocking at me;

>And I staring hard into his gaping holes

>Makes me realize one of so many mistakes,

>I made in my crazy appetite;

>That I am not the only one who makes these unearthly lashes

>Upon the world so wide:

>That to every love, there is hate;

>That where there is death, there is life;

>And good and evil are manifestations of a simple truth;

>The will to survive.
