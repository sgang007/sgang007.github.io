If you have come across a strong personality, you know what I mean. Some people with their charisma and gaze have such a hold of other people's mind that they can easily influence anyone. That is the mental power of a person.

And you know what the biggest secret is? This power is hidden inside everyone and waiting to be released. Lets talk about how you can unleash this power.


Well, first of all you need to improve your lifestyle so that your mind has full control of all your actions. Most of us are emotional with many things in life and these emotions makes us to irrational and impromptu decisions sometime. Controlling these emotions and guiding them to your benefit can give your mind full control of your life. Well, after all if you can't control yourself how can you ever control other.

- **Know yourself**

On an average, more than a million thoughts races across the human mind in less than a second. Controlling, segrating and understanding these thoughts is no easy task and requires a great deal of practice. So, I will tell about some rules which if you follow will help you to understand yourself.

- First of all, you must understand that you do not need to control your flow your thoughts that much. Rather, you need to understand why are you thinking the thoughts that is currently racing across your mind and that is knowing oneself. So, each time you make a rash decision or any peculiar thought that races across your mind, you need to ask the question 'Why did I think so?'. Every thought is governed by some personality trait that is hidden inside you and when your trying to discover the cause of your thoughts, you are actually discovering these hidden personality traits within you.
> Once you have been doing this for quite some time, you will soon discover a whole new side to your personality that you never thought you had in you. After you are feeling confident, imagine yourself in a very awkward situation that you have never faced before and try to guess what you might do in that situation. Then find such a situation in real life and purposely involve yourself and see if what you guessed is actually how you behave. If you can correctly predict what your reactions would be in all these situations, you are ready to move to the next step.

- **Control yourself**

Since you can already predict what you would do in a particular situation, you now have the power to prevent that from happening. It is simple you need to choose a reaction that you would have wanted from yourself in the particular situation and revert back your steps affecting such a reaction until you reach a action that is easily controllable by you.

For example, you know that you can't control if your class-teacher scolds you for coming late and you might end up abusing him in front of everyone. The reaction that you would have liked from yourself was quietly smiling and sliding back to the last bench of your classroom without ever uttering a word to your teacher. So, the easiest thing is to control yourself when the teacher scolds you but you know yourself that you might not be able to control your impulse or anger then. So, it is better to prevent the cause and not be late for class. But then again, it has been a habbit for you to wake up late so you can't control that. Now, the cause for waking up late maybe staying up till midnight the previous night when you were socializing with friends. So, to prevent the cause you need to get to bed early but again you can't resist the enticing conversations with your friends. To prevent this cause, either reduce your friends circle or tell your friends to talk to you later. 

So, in the end a thing like reducing your friend circle can have an ultimate effect of you having a good impression in front of your class-teacher and ultimately that might result in liberal marking from him and lots of stuff.

> Keep controlling all your actions like this until you are exactly like the personality you want to be and you are always happy with what you are. When you have been doing this for quite some time, you will be extremely confident of whatever decisions you take. This confidence is the hidden mental power and charisma that will help you to control others.

- **Pick who you want to control**
Now, you have fairly good control over yourself and it is time to excercise your mental power on someone else. For starter, pick someone who is younger in age to you, have less control over themselves and are easily susceptible to stronger influences and experiment on them. A younger brother or a younger sister or a not so intelligent friend would be a good subject to experiment on.

Start by talking to your subject on the most common and yet very debatable topics that might interest him. For a teenage guys, video games and for teenage girls, romantic movies are a good starting point. Try to get as much opinion out of him as possible and then try to reason the cause behind his opinion without asking him and then ask him whether the reason behind his opinion is same as the one you guessed. Keep doing this for quite some time until you know his opinion for most of the stuff in his life and the reasons behind them. Don't just gather the immediate reasons but the causes for the reasons and the causes for those causes until you get an idea of who the real person is and what is he like.

But this is just the peripheral personality of the person and every person has a hidden personality which contributes more to their entire thought process. And you need to learn this hidden personality, if you want to know him well. But he won't tell you, so you need to push his limits. Make him do the things he normally wouldn't and tell him things that he wouldn't expect from you. Bring all elements of surprise to him and see how he reacts and from his reactions, you can determine the causes of such reactions and push him more to see if the causes you guessed are correct.
> After some time, you will know this person like you know yourself. You can close your eyes and imagine the reaction of this person in a particular situation and push him to such a situation and see if the reaction you imagined is actually correct. Very soon, you will be fairly confident about all the hidden traits and entire personality of this person. 

- **Influencing others**
Now that you know your subject so well, you can very easily control all his actions and his entire personality. The only problem is every mature person has some kind of personal space in their mind and when you are trying to manipulate him, you are actually invading his personal space and immediately the person will be alert to your manipulation and all your hard-work will go down the drain. So you have to invade his personal space without his knowledge and how to do that?

The person whom you are manipulating will only understand that you are trying to 
manipulate him if your actions or words have very close relation to the words spoken by him and if he understands that you have been judging his reactions. So, the way to manipulate a person is to influence him in ways which(in his mind) has no relation to his actions. 

Like for an example, you want to curb the lying habits of a person. You reason that he lies mostly because he doesn't have the courage to face the truth himself. So, he cannot trust others with the truth. One cause for lack of courage is lack of confidence in oneself and lack of self-confidence is mostly due to depressing environment factors. So, you need to always cheer him up and motivate him and tell good things about him and hide is faults and very soon, you will curb him of his lying habits. All these causes for his habits is specific to a person and must be determined by how well you know the person.

Most importantly, you need to assess the intelligence of the person and try to imagine if the person is capable of doing the manipulation you are doing. If he is capable of doing it, he is also capable of understanding when you are doing it. And if he understands that you are manipulating him, he pull up his shield and all your actions won't have any more effect on him. So, based on his intelligence, you need to devise extremely clever and complicated ways to influence his thoughts indirectly.

> After enough practice and experience, you will soon be a very charismatic personality with immense mental power and you can influence people on the go. World renowned mentalists can look in a person's eyes for a few minutes and tell what they are thinking. If you are a peron with average or more than average intelligence, with enough practice for a year, you can speak with some stranger on the train for a few hours and change his or her life forever.

*Lastly, I want to conclude by telling that manipulation and influence is an art that can only be practised by people with a lot of mental power. Respect this power and never use it for selfish means.*
