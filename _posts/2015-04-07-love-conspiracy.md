Every teenager in this world is in search of the magic feeling; that strong emotion that binds the entire universe together;that brings together people and makes life possible. The strong enticing enigma called true love.
There are so many articles and ideas on this that it is very difficult to relate to all of them.

In this post, I will try to explain love in my own way. Every person is entitled to his own opinion, so feel free to differ by posting your comments.

There is no doubt of the fact that love deals with people and brings people closer to each other. To understand love, we need to first understand people and how our emotions react to different situations.

##The Romantic Type

Every person is exposed to a variety of environments during the course of his life. All these environments provide some amount of emotional response within the person. These emotional responses account for all the good and bad experiences he has had in different environments. With each experience, our human mind tries to learn something so that the mind can better deal with the experience in future. The more experiences you have, the more you will learn. Just like the saying: *Wisdom comes with experience*

Lets try to understand this with an example:
Suppose, two children are given to do the same task. After doing the task, they both go and tell their mother about it. The first mother congratulates his son and gives him a chocolate. The little kid loves chocolates and he immediately registers in his mind that the task he had done was good and kept it in his good books. All the while, the second mother rebukes her kid, scolds him for doing the task and gives him a beating. The kid does not like getting a beating so he immediately registers the task in his bad books and learns that the task that he had done was bad. The love for chocolates and fear of beating also was due to some similar incident previously. In the end, all our emotions are based on previous experience and all our life, we keep increasing the list in our good book and the bad book.

>So, when we meet someone and realize that he/she possesses some traits or characteristics which cover a major portion of our good books, we immediately start liking him/her. If all the traits that this person has are the same traits you loved previously, you immediately start liking her. This person is your crush or your romantic type.

##The Compromising Type

We have already established that your love for someone is a very personal choice which depends on your past experiences. So, love is not an instant thing but it is planned by your subconcious mind way before you actually meet your love. 

Now, the problem is what if you do not fall in the good books of your love or you are not the type your partner desires. This is seldom the case because meeting your romantic type and having all the qualities of your partner's romantic type is highly improbable as each person's romantic type is very unique.

The solution is that the person who does not get his/her romantic type will compromise. She will love the fact that you love her but she will never be actually in love with you in the same way you are in love with her. The reason for this compromise lies in the fact that every person feels the need to be loved by someone, to be cared by someone, to rely on someone and to know that someone will be there for her when she is down. This need to be loved overshadows the desire to love someone and the person makes a compromise for the greater good.

> But the truth is that being loved by someone and loving someone irrevocably are not the same. You feel nice that someone cares for you but you are missing the spark of emotions- the feeling of love. Thus, the person who makes this compromise will always be more rational in the relationship and will be a controlling and dominating factor in the relationship. This person is the compromising type.

#The Grand Conspiracy

In the end, you and your partner will never love each other in the same way. One person will always be dominating and the other person will always be subdued but the levels of this domination and submission will always vary.

Supposing, you are in love with someone and you are in a healthy relationship with him/her. It has been only possible because your partner gave up searching for his/her love and accepted you by making the compromise. 

Let's take an ideal world where every peron's romantic type is unqiue and everyone has found the people they love. There are 3 couples existing in this world named as Couple1,Couple2,Couple3 as given in the diagram. The arrow shows which person loves whom.

Thus, we can see only half the people i.e. Boy1, Boy2 and Girl3 have found their true love and are in a relationship with them while Girl1, Girl2 and Boy3 have made the compromise.

Thus, if there are 6 billion people in the world and assuming every person has one unique romantic type in some part of the world. Then, only half the people of the world will ever find their true love in an ideal world.

In reality, there may be two or more persons having the same romantic type and then it depends who approaches first. There could be the case someone's romantic type is already made a compromise with someone else. When all this factors are taken into account, your chances of having a relationship with the person you love reduces drastically to a mere 20 or 30 percent.

>So in conclusion, if you spend your entire life searching for your true love among 6 billion people, the chances that you will find him/her and be in a relationship with the person is a mere 20 percent. Even after that, your love will never be truly happy with you and never love you the same way you do.
This is the Grand Conspiracy of the world and the illusion spread in the name of love.
