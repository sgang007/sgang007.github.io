Destiny is indeed a pecuiliar thing. While some people may believe in it and others may not, everyone has an opinion about. Interesting it gets, when a debate on such a topic goes on. Eventually all such debates boils to down concrete statements, people who believe that their destiny is bound and have no control over the future and others who believe that everyone creates their own destiny and they have complete control of their future. Observing such a debate, one can easily notice there are extremely valid points on both sides. While there are numerous examples of people who rose from poverty and amassed great fortune, there is an equally compelling thought that a blind person can never become a pilot, even if he devotes his entire life to such an ambition. Then if neither statements are completely true, the question remains what is detiny?

The understanding of destiny is not a single concept but rather an assimilation of several concepts involving the past, present and future of person's life. It is more like a plan for the future taking into account the innnate personality of an individual. So, if a person is good in maths and sports, he might be destined to become a sports analyst or something similar in the future or a very curious person, who is good at science might be destined to become a scientist in future. Destiny is determined by a person's talents. But if it was so simple, then why there are so many people wasting their talents while living a pathetic life.
