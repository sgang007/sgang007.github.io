Thanks Ishika for reminding me about my blog. This was an incomplete post for long but today I will complete it.

Well, when we think about college what comes first to your mind? Is it the cool science gadgets shown or the first crush you had or the night long rave party you always dreamt about?
Whatever comes to your mind first defines what you are and what you want in life. Its the self manifestation of ourselves in our own perspective that defines our future and not some external probing procedure crafted by the so called ingenious people who don't give a damn about you. Ohh...what the hell did I just write?
In simple words, *you decide your future* and not some petty ass competitive exam.

**Now, what makes up a college**
A college is not made by the quality of professors it has nor the research work it is doing nor the amazing infrastructure it might or it might not have. A college is made by the students it has and the mentality of the average student in the college reflects the college's image as a whole. 

Not convinced yet, then do a survey on some guys who are in final year and are just about to leave college and a similar survey on sophomore guys from the same college. 
The results will astound you:
>Maximum guys from junior years will tell you how much they hate this college and how they wished they had never come here.
The same guys when they reach senior year, they would tell you how this same college was the best thing that ever happened to them and what would they not do to relive the college life again. (Some extremely emotional guys might even start crying out of nostalgia)

Well, the college hasn't changed, the students haven't changed then the question is *Why is there a differnce in opnion? What has changed?*
The answer is simple. Its the students who have changed. Initially, when these guys just looked at their college for they very first time, they only saw the external factors like the college infrastructure, food quality in the mess, clean campus and all that. So, they initially had a very bad opinion about their college as it probably did not meet their expectations. 
Slowly, as time passed, they adapted themselves to all these discrepancies and started to fit in college with others like them. They made new friends, maybe met their first love, enjoyed doing some crazy stuff and finally, bonded with the college at an emotional level. All because, they found people like them who thought more or less alike. 
>Suffice to say, the majority students in a college have a similar outlook and it reflects the image of the college. A college filled with students who all love to party and have fun will definitely not have a lot of research output. Naturally, a college filled with nerds will have a lesser DJ night culture and more research culture. 

The admimission procedure to colleges is designed to group people into colleges which are like them and no college is better or worse than the other. Your college is and always had been your choice subconsciously and you know that.

**Now, the question remains, how can we assertain the integrity of this admission procedure?**
Yeah, thats a tough question. How can we really do this? Very baffling question indeed. The system of competitive exams is just so that this grouping of students in the best possible way.
