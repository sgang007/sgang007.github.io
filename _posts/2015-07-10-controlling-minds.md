## Art of Manipulation

Everyone of us has seen Professor X controlling everyone's minds in X-men. What if I tell you such a thing is possible is no fiction and is very much possible in real life.
If you have come across a strong personality, you know what I mean. Some people with their charisma and gaze have such a hold of other people's mind that they can easily influence anyone. That is the mental power of a person.

And you know what the biggest secret is? This power is hidden inside everyone and waiting to be released. Lets talk about how you can unleash this power.


Well, first of all you need to improve your lifestyle so that your mind has full control of all your actions. Most of us are emotional with many things in life and these emotions makes us to irrational and impromptu decisions sometime. Controlling these emotions and guiding them to your benefit can give your mind full control of your life. Well, after all if you can't control yourself how can you ever control other.

- **Know thyself**

On an average, more than a million thoughts races across the human mind in less than a second. Controlling, segrating and understanding these thoughts is no easy task and requires a great deal of practice. So, I will tell about some rules which if you follow will help you to understand yourself.

- First of all, you must understand that you do not need to control your flow your thoughts that much. Rather, you need to understand why are you thinking the thoughts that is currently racing across your mind and that is knowing oneself. So, each time you make a rash decision or any peculiar thought that races across your mind, you need to ask the question 'Why did I think so?'. Every thought is governed by some personality trait that is hidden inside you and when your trying to discover the cause of your thoughts, you are actually discovering these hidden personality traits within you.
> Once you have been doing this for quite some time, you will soon discover a whole new side to your personality that you never thought you had in you. After you are feeling confident, imagine yourself in a very awkward situation that you have never faced before and try to guess what you might do in that situation. Then find such a situation in real life and purposely involve yourself and see if what you guessed is actually how you behave. If you can correctly predict what your reactions would be in all these situations, you are ready to move to the next step.

- **Control yourself**

Since you can already predict what you would do in a particular situation, you now have the power to prevent that from happening. It is simple you need to choose a reaction that you would have wanted from yourself in the particular situation and revert back your steps affecting such a reaction until you reach a action that is easily controllable by you.

For example, you know that you can't control if your class-teacher scolds you for coming late and you might end up abusing him in front of everyone. The reaction that you would have liked from yourself was quietly smiling and sliding back to the last bench of your classroom without ever uttering a word to your teacher. So, the easiest thing is to control yourself when the teacher scolds you but you know yourself that you might not be able to control your impulse or anger then. So, it is better to prevent the cause and not be late for class. But then again, it has been a habbit for you to wake up late so you can't control that. Now, the cause for waking up late maybe staying up till midnight the previous night when you were socializing with friends. So, to prevent the cause you need to get to bed early but again you can't resist the enticing conversations with your friends. To prevent this cause, either reduce your friends circle or tell your friends to talk to you later. 

So, in the end a thing like reducing your friend circle can have an ultimate effect of you having a good impression in front of your class-teacher and ultimately that might result in liberal marking from him and lots of stuff.

> Keep controlling all your actions like this until you are exactly like the personality you want to be and you are always happy with what you are. When you have been doing this for quite some time, you will be extremely confident of whatever decisions you take. This confidence is the hidden mental power and charisma that will help you to control others.

- **Pick who you want to control**
