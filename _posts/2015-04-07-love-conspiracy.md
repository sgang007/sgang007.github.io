Every teenager in this world is in search of the magic feeling; that strong emotion that binds the entire universe together;that brings together people and makes life possible. The strong enticing enigma called true love.

Here are some thoughts Google has on love:
"True love can never be searched. It can be only be found"
"True love never ends"
"True love is knowing a persons faults, and loving them even more for them"

And here are some thoughts what an average teenager has to say:
"True love is overrated. It exists only in movies"
"It requires courage to find true love. You need to fight for it."
"You need confidence to find your true love"

To, all of the, I say: Its bullshit

>True Love is a conspiracy. A fail safe mechanism designed by nature to bring different people together in order to maintain the variabality and diversity within a species. Truth me told, its highly over-rated.

Flabbergasted! Are you.
Lets see why I said so.
