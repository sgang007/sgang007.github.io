title: How useful is college education
published: true

Aah... this is a question that baffles every teenager but we still haven't arrived at a concrete conclusion.
The reason for this is due to the fact no one has been able to provide a better alternative to the current system till date. Moreover, the current system of college education is looked upon as a standard in determining your expertise over a particular field. But the fact is that everyone's true potential cannot be benchmarked with the current college system. It is optimized for the average population and not suitable for the brilliant few.


##College is shit
Well, several people have put forward their views why people should drop out of college and start innovating on their own. The main reason is that the exam system in colleges discourages students with good potential from thinking out of the box. We all know how stereotype our examination system is. First, we study a lot of stuff as taught by our professors and then after memorizing then, reproduce it in our exams. Apparently, it looks that the only thing an examination system tests is memory.
