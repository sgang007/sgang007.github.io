For centuries, we have always wondered and be amazed by the concept of an omnipresent, omniscient and omnipotent God whose power is responsible for the existence of our universe. And people who are amazed by this concept keep pursuing this for decades until they fade into oblivion. But no one till date has been able to prove the existence of such a power and we have always been known to be the masters of our own fate. This is has been the longest and most endearing research project of mankind and it has no concludable answers till date.

The simple reason for this is because we have been looking in the wrong place. While we have been looking for an all powerful source of creation in the microscopic universe to the distant galaxies, the real God power resides within us and each living being on this planet holds a potential to become this omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient source. The only way we are going to become this person is through the journey or the path to God. It is this lifelong search for God through which we truly become a source of knowledge, wisdom and power. 

Whatever I said till now was just mere philosophy which might appeal some people, most people will definitely not concur with it until a logical and sound argument is provided of whatever philosophy I just said. Now, I will try to tell my views and experiences in my search for God.

In our search for God, each day our brain learns and develops some new things until we reach the truth. With each new development, our understanding of the world changes and we each day we face more question than we solved. And through this quest, we pass through different phases in our personality until we meet our destiny.

Our most primitive mindset and our basic intelligence is governed by our survival instinct. To stay alive, we need to eat and fulfil our basic amenities. So, when we are hungry, we look for food; when we need food, we look for money; when we need money, we look for a job; when we need a job, we look for the education required to get the job; when we need the education, we look for colleges who can give that education; when we need the help of colleges, we look for tutors who can help us get to this college - and the list goes on endlessly. In this competitive and overpopulated world, at a certain point of time we realize that just doing what we need to do might not get us what we want. So, we would need to prevent others from getting what they want so that we might get what we want. And this results to cut-throat competition, selfish behaviour and a lot of other evils which is just the correct attitude one needs to have if he has to survive. And finally everything we fight for and all evils in this world just boils down to one simple truth: Survival of the fittest. In due course, our world has become capable of containing everyone and we have all the resources for survival of everyone but the nature of a fight is that it never ends.

As a result of this fight for survival, we develop a keen sense of our logical mind. We start thinking in terms of black and white - we divide the entire world into things that are right and should be done and things that are wrong that shouldn't be done. We categorize these things based on the logic whether something will help us in our survival or not.  For example, studying for your exams, getting a good marks, doing a good job, living an honest life and caring for your family are all the correct things and the opposite of all these are the bad things that shouldn't be done. Making the correct choices and how fit you are survival shows how intelligent you are and this is the logical mind, which is measured by someone's IQ.
