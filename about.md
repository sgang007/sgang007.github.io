I study Mechanical Engineering from NIT Jamshedpur which I do not like at all. Hopefully, my degree will be complete and I will leave this place by 2016. Currently, I am unmarried and have no children whose photos I can put up here. 
Oh. I did my schooling from Don Bosco Liluah - ahh! those days were amazing. I was a very mischieveous boy then and I am still notorious now. Hmmm, what else can I say. If you want to know more about me, contact me via facebook, email or github. Check out the icons down below.

### Interests
Well, I love doing new things experimenting with them and learning from them. In this way, I have developed skills for several things other than robotics, of course.

First of all, I am a good cook. Call me up and I might invite you in for a treat someday. I love cooking desserts mainly and I have also done several chicken recipes including the KFC chicken.

Other than that, I love painting a lot. If you are my facebook friend, go to my photos section and you will have pics of many paintings that I had done.

Obviously, I love watching movies and listening to music. My taste varies but mostly I love artsy movies with some inner meaning or so and I love listening to Clint Mansell and Lindsey Stirling.
