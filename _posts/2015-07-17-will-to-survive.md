I wrote this poem a long time back during my first semester in college in a state of mind when I was lonely, depressed and frustrated with everything in life. I showed this poem to several people at that time and everyone liked it mostly because of its poetic appeal. But yesterday after writing my post on 'Moksha', I remembered this poem I had once written and now looked at it from a whole new different angle. I had these concepts of life in my subconscious mind long back but yesterday, I could construct it and represent them in a way by which most people could understand. 
So, to complete my idea of Life and bring forth an element of elegance, I am putting up this lost poem in my blog today.

*Please read my previous post on Moksha before reading this poem to understand the real meaning of the words I had said.*
